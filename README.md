# Fluence CLI

Fluence is a decentralized serverless platform & computing marketplace powered
by blockchain economics. Fluence is a global, permissionless, scalable, and
secure alternative to centralized cloud computing platforms.

Fluence CLI is designed to be the only tool that you need to manage the life
cycle of applications written on [Fluence](https://fluence.network). It provides
project scaffolding, compilation, service deployment, dependency management and
installation, storage of keys and ids, etc.
