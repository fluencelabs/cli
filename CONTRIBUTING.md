## Contribute Code

You are welcome to contribute to Fluence CLI!

Things you need to know:

1.  You need to **agree to the [Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/fluencelabs-org/3f4cbb3cc14c1c0fb9ad99d8f7316ed7) (CLA)**. This is a common practice in all major Open Source projects. At the current moment, we are unable to accept contributions made on behalf of a company. Only individual contributions will be accepted.

2.  **Not all proposed contributions can be accepted**. Some features may, e.g., just fit a third-party add-on better. The contribution must fit the overall direction of Fluence and really improve it. The more effort you invest, the better you should clarify in advance whether the contribution fits: the best way would be to just open an issue to discuss the contribution you plan to make.

### Contributor License Agreement

When you contribute, you have to be aware that your contribution is covered by **[Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE)**, but might relicensed under few other software licenses mentioned in the **Contributor License Agreement**. In particular, you need to agree to the Contributor License Agreement. If you agree to its content, you simply have to click on the link posted by the CLA assistant as a comment to the pull request. Click it to check the CLA, then accept it on the following screen if you agree to it. The CLA assistant will save this decision for upcoming contributions and will notify you if there is any change to the CLA in the meantime.

## Guidelines for contributors

-   **First** commit in your PR or PR title must use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (optionally end your commit message with: `[fixes DXJ-000 DXJ-001]`. Where `DXJ-000` and `DXJ-001` are ids of the Linear issues that you were working on)
-   After doing `pnpm install` you need to also do `pnpm before-build` before moving any further
-   To use Fluence CLI in the development mode, run: `./bin/dev.js` (types are not checked in development mode because it's faster and more convenient to work with. Use typechecking provided by your IDE during development)
-   To use Fluence CLI in the production mode, run `pnpm run build` first, then run: `./bin/run.js`. If you want to make sure you are running the actual package the users will use, do `pnpm build`, `pnpm pack` and install this tar package (the approach is used for tests)
-   Don't name arguments or flags with names that contain underscore symbols because autogenerated links in markdown will not work
-   Don't export anything from command files except for the command itself. If you need to share code between commands - create a separate file
-   Avoid using `this` in commands except for inside `initCli` function. This style is easier to understand and there will be less stuff to refactor if instead of using methods on command object you simply use separate functions which can later be moved outside into a separate module for reuse in other commands
-   Use `commandObj.error` (or `throw new CLIError`) for human readable errors. They will be reported to analytics as events. Use `throw new Error` (or `assert`) for unexpected errors. They will be reported to analytics as crashes.
-   Don't use colors inside commands descriptions. They can't be rendered to markdown and they will not be rendered to users of the packaged Fluence CLI anyway, when they run `--help`
-   To run tests locally you need to do the following:
    1. Make sure you have docker installed (it's most convenient and reliable if you install Docker Desktop by following the instruction for your operating system on their official website)
    1. `cd .github/e2e` dir of this repo. Set environment variable for rust peer image. Make sure to use the `nox` from `src/versions.json`.
       Example in `bash`:
       `export RUST_PEER_IMAGE="fluencelabs/nox:minimal"`
       Example in `fish`:
       `export const RUST_PEER_IMAGE="fluencelabs/nox:minimal"`))
    1. run `docker compose up -d`
    1. `cd` back to repo root dir. Set env variable `FLUENCE_ENV="local"` so tests run against your local peers
    1. run `pnpm test` which will lint and check the code, build it, package it, prepare the tests and run them
-   To update or install npm dependencies - just change package.json manually and let the CI do the updating properly. CI does `npm shrinkwrap` and `pnpm import` for you so all transient dependency versions can be locked and minor versions patched for the end users while still giving the CLI developers and CI itself a way to install dependencies more quickly using pnpm
